# dota-2-lua-abilities
A repository for creating Dota 2 Lua abilities.

# Dota Cosmetics
Also check out for my custom game to test hero cosmetics: [Dota Alternate: Cosmetics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1828497677)
GitHub code will be released later.

# Tutorial
Tutorial is available on this repo's wiki. It is rarely updated, but it will be. Just have a patience.

# How to test
* Download the repository,
* put it in `"yourdotafolder/game/dota_addons"`,
* Launch Dota, run in console using `"dota_launch_custom_game dota-2-lua-abilities dota"`

(Note: You may need cheat mode on to test abilities easily)

# Notes
If you need help, you can find me at [Moddota Discord](https://moddota.com/).

Some abilities are implemented differently than in-game, and it was intended.

As the repo grew larger, I could no longer guarantee the abilities to be bug-free.
If you find a bug (and its bugging you), help this repo by issuing an issue.

If you want an ability to be implemented, you can also issue a regular issue.
Note that this is just a side-project: it is not always on my attention.
